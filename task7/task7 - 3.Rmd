3. For the data set bricksq:
(a) Split the data into two parts using
```{r}
bricks1 <- window(bricksq, end=1987.99)
bricks2 <- window(bricksq, start=1988)
````
(b) Check that your data have been split appropriately by produc-

ing the following plot.
plot(bricksq)
lines(bricks1,col="red")
lines(bricks2,col="blue")
(c) Calculate forecasts using each of the four benchmark methods
applied to bricks1.
(d) Compare the accuracy of your forecasts against the actual val-
ues stored in bricks2. For example:
f1 <- meanf(bricks1)
accuracy(f1,bricks2)
(e) Which method does best? Why?
(f) For the best method, compute the residuals and plot them. For
example
res <- residuals(f1)
plot(res)
hist(res, breaks="FD")
Acf(res)
Do the residuals appear to be uncorrelated and normally dis-
tributed?
